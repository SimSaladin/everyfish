This is a game where you crush cockroaches with your hands and attempt to
conquer the arena by marking it with dyed cockroach blood. Sounds crazy? It's
because it is rather stupid

## TODO

- The cockroaches:
  - ~~animations~~
  - random walk
- Game ~~start~~ and end
- ~~Different colors for different players~~
- Scoring: controlled area, number of killed cockroaches, what else? style
  points?
- Prettier splats (animated)
- Different types of splats
- Map gestures to splats - do we need a custom driver for myo?
- A "crusher hand" cursor
- Background image
- Set up running somewhere. Domain?
