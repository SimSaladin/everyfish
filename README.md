This is a game where you crush cockroaches with your hands and attempt to
conquer the arena by marking it with dyed cockroach blood. Sounds crazy? It's
because it is rather stupid

## TODO

- ~~The cockroaches~~:
  - ~~animations~~
  - ~~random walk~~
- Game ~~start~~ and ~~end~~
- ~~Different colors for different players~~
- Scoring: ~~controlled area~~, number of killed cockroaches, what else? style
  points?
- ~~roach colors~~
- ~~Fix splat draw order~~
- Prettier splats (animated)
- Map myo to different splats
  - do we need a custom driver for myo?
  - use velocity
- ~~A "crusher hand" cursor~~
- pointer lock or other features for miss clicks and UX?
- Background image - or will it be too confusing/dirty?
- Set up running somewhere. Domain?
- New splats end up below old splats
